## Overview
This repository contains nearstack source code, include: frontend, backend, AI and landing page.
Nearstack is an innovative platform designed to streamline Web3 frontend development, specifically for applications built on the NEAR Protocol. Leveraging AI-generated code suggestions, Nearstack simplifies the development process and boosts productivity. The platform includes a React flow interface, allowing developers to visualize and understand the relationships between components, making it easier to manage complex frontend architectures.

## Features

- ***AI-Powered Code Suggestions***

  Provides intelligent code suggestions to speed up development and reduce errors.
  Tailored AI recommendations based on NEAR and Web3 development patterns.
- ***NEAR BOS Component Integration***

  Allows seamless integration and management of NEAR BOS components within frontend projects.
  Simplifies access to blockchain components, enhancing the Web3 development experience.
- ***React Flow Visualization***

  Features a React flow interface to map out component relationships visually.
  Makes it easy to understand how components connect, interact, and influence one another.
- ***Intuitive Component Interaction Mapping***

  Easily links components (e.g., Component A to Component B) for a clear, organized development workflow.
  Improves code maintainability and clarity, especially for larger projects.
- ***Efficient Frontend Development***

  Streamlines frontend code management, allowing developers to focus on functionality rather than setup.
  Combines visual mapping with NEAR components to optimize the dApp-building process.
